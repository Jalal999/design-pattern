# design-pattern
This project required to use the Adapter, the Singleton and the Factory patterns.


The problem is to design a modern User Interface (UI) that supports multiple design styles
(motif or "look and feel"). The core of the UI is the single Window Manager (WM), which is
responsible for the management of the UI items, such as buttons, text boxes and edit boxes.
Different design styles are supported by the system: simplistic design style, high detailed design
style and futuristic design style. WM should be initialized only by specifying the design style.
Each UI item looks differently when the design style of the system is different. Also, each item
has a value, which is displayed on the item itself (i.e., value of a button is the text displayed on
the button).
The structure of a UI is described in a special config file of comma separated values. This file
contains the structure of a UI as a list of UI items, their values and their coordinates. Example of
a config file:

Button, Click on me, X: 250, Y: 300
EditBox, Some text to edit, X: 250, Y: 350
...

A Config Manager class is responsible for loading config files. It has methods nextItem() â€“
returns the next item in the list and hasMoreItems() - returns true if iterating through the list is not over yet. Window Manager has a method loadUI(ConfigManager config), which goes through the config step by step and displays all UI items.
To extend the functionality of the system, it must also be possible to load the configuration
from an XML file. Your application should adapt one of the native java XML parsing methods
(DOM Parser/Builder, SAX Parser, Java XML I/O) and make it compatible with the
ConfigManager interface. Example of an XML file:
<Button value="Click on me" X="250" Y="300" />
<EditBox value="Some text to edit" X="250" Y="350" />
...
Finally, to test the system, load UI elements from a config file, then from an XML file and
then create several items during the runtime programmatically.
